# Fidelity: the port against an N64 reference (Phase 7 round 9, x3)

This page covers the reference ("oracle") built from the user's ROM on a headless N64 emulator:
how to run it, what it showed, and the per-scene differences. **Never commit a captured frame or
RDRAM dump.** They are derived from the ROM, so keep them in a scratch directory.

## 1. The oracle

Debian packages, installed on the box (headless; Xvfb is a virtual display, no window):

```sh
apt install mupen64plus-ui-console mupen64plus-video-rice mupen64plus-video-glide64mk2 \
            mupen64plus-video-z64 mupen64plus-rsp-hle mupen64plus-rsp-z64 \
            mupen64plus-input-sdl libmupen64plus-dev xvfb xauth
```

Plugin results under Xvfb (Mesa llvmpipe):

| video plugin | result |
|---|---|
| **Rice** (HLE) | **works**: correct frames, F3DEX2 lighting, fog, HUD. ~1,100 emulator frames/min with screenshots |
| Glide64mk2 (HLE) | every screenshot is black (972-byte PNGs), with or without its FBO wrapper |
| z64 + rsp-z64 (LLE) | too slow (no frame in 3 minutes); not usable |

There is no angrylion package, so this is an HLE reference: Rice's combiner and texture filtering
are not bit-exact to the RDP. Use it to compare **what** is drawn (objects, lights, colours,
layout), not pixel values. The CPU, the game logic and RDRAM are exact.

**`tools/port/refshots.py`** drives `libmupen64plus` through ctypes, the same way
`mupen64plus-ui-console --testshots` does, but it can also dump RDRAM and press buttons:

```sh
xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1024x768x24" python3 tools/port/refshots.py \
    --rom baserom.us.z64 --out /tmp/ref --shots 1100,2000:2400:10 --rdram 1150,2700 \
    [--input "START@1500 A@1600 Z@2000..2050"] [--gfx rice] [--frames N]
# -> /tmp/ref/shot_<frame>.png (640x480), /tmp/ref/rdram_<frame>.bin (8 MB, N64 byte order)
```

- Controller 1 is a keyboard-mapped standard controller with a **Controller Pak**, a blank pak per
  run (`--keep-pak` keeps it), the same as the port's `--pak-blank`. With `--input dummy` the game
  stops at "CONTROLLER PAK NOT FOUND".
- Buttons: `A B Z START R L CU CD CL CR DU DD DL DR` and the stick `SL SR SU SD`;
  `NAME@F` is a short press, `NAME@F1..F2` holds the button (as in the port's `--input`).
- **Frame numbers are the emulator's**: one per new frame buffer, which is one game frame. The port's
  `--frames` and `T2_SHOT` count VIs. The ratio is not constant, so align scenes by event. Boot,
  emulator vs port: legal 50/298, expansion pak 450/1070, Acclaim 600/1362, Iguana cinema
  850/1850, title 1400/4212, demo 1 1990/5467, the legal screen again 3150/8900.
- RDRAM lookups: symbol addresses come from `build/ref.elf` (`nm`). An offset is
  `addr & 0x7FFFFF` into the dump. Structures are at their **N64** offsets, e.g. `gScene`
  0x800F7078 (`m_pActors` +0xE0, `m_nFirstActor` +0xE4, `m_nActors` +0xE8), instances 0x288
  bytes apart (`m_dwFlags` +0xD4, `m_Lights[2]` +0x110), `gSceneLights` 0x800AB0D0,
  `gEngineApp_m_Game_m_CameraPool_m_MainCamera` 0x801198F0 (`m_ViewMin/Max` +0x338).
  `gScene.m_nSectors` reads 0 between frames on both machines (the per-frame list is cleared),
  so lights that depend on it can only be compared from inside a frame.

## 2. Findings

### 2.1 Translucent instances and static objects were never drawn (fixed)

On the N64, the Iguana cinema shows the iguana on the logo, the iguana with the binoculars and the
iguana with the gun (emulator 850-1350). The port showed the jungle and the logo, but **no
iguana**. The RDRAM dump at 1150 shows actor #50 at (-2895, 358, -870), flags 0x13072305, lit
050505/ffffb5. The port has the same 52 actors, and #50 animates there too. Its flags have bit 4
(translucent), so `CScene__DrawRegisteredInstances` defers it to `CScene.m_pDeferred`, which
`CScene__DrawSortedList` (func_0022077C) draws later. That function read the list through an N64
view of the world (`count` at 0x1064, `items` at 0x1068). On the host those offsets land elsewhere
in `CScene`, so **no flag-4 instance and no deferred (translucent) static object was ever drawn**.
The fix is a `TARGET_PORT` view by host offset (`m_nDeferred`, `m_pDeferred`,
`CInstanceHeader.m_vPos`, `CStaticObject.m_Bounds`). After it, the three iguana shots match the
N64. asm_diff is 0.

### 2.2 The enemies' black silhouettes: the lighting matches the N64

The data was checked step by step against RDRAM:

- **The light volumes** (`LightVolume_Construct`, the 0xC0 records): in the Iguana level every
  record found in RDRAM by its colour has the same falloff, value, colour, inverse matrix and box
  as on the port.
- **`CScene__ComputeLights`** at the same point gives the same lights. Demo 1, level 81, enemy 6
  at (1974.4, 0, -904.4), emulator frame 2600: the N64 instance holds ambient `2d1a05`, colour
  `fff80b`, direction (c8 ee 70). The port, probed at (1974.4, 30..60, -904.4), gives ambient
  `2d1a05`, colour `fff80b`, direction (cc f8 73)/(cd f3 73). The Iguana level's actor lights
  (`22230f`/`e6ef6a`) are identical too.
- `gSceneLights` / `gDefaultLights` (383838, ffffff, (b0 39 bc) / (00 00 7f)) are identical.

So the actor lighting is faithful. The silhouettes in the level-52/81 test scenes are places
where the volumes give almost nothing: level 52 at the enemy, ambient `0a0c10` and colour
`0e1014`, because the bright volume there (93, 113, 125) is a sphere that does not reach the
enemy's centre. The N64 draws its enemies the same way in dark corridors: demo 1 at emulator
frame 2550 shows a dark figure with only its red eyes visible, and the enemies turn amber once
they reach the lit room (2600-2950). `G_MOVEMEM` lights, the normals and Fast3D's lighting were
not changed. No fix needed. Seeing it in one frame on both machines needs demo 1 to follow the
same path (2.4).

### 2.3 The legal screen's text is dimmer and more orange

At the same moment the N64's legal text peaks at (200, 200, 138), mean (110, 107, 73). The port's
peaks at (80, 64, 40), mean (62, 51, 32), the same on every frame from 401 to 901. Open: check the
text's primitive/environment colour and the IA font texture's intensity on the host (the fonts
are TARGET_PORT-swapped data).

### 2.4 Demo 1 does not follow the N64 from its first frame (both hosts)

On the N64 the demo starts in level 81 facing a door with the war blade. At ~2020 it opens the
wheel and picks the plasma rifle (on screen 2050). It walks through the door into the amber room
(2120-2200), meets the first enemy at ~2390 and takes damage 100 -> 92 -> 84 -> 67 -> 59 -> 57
-> 56 -> 51. The demo ends at ~3150. The port's first demo frame already has the wheel open
(`reqw 14`), move (1, 0) and buttons 0x101. The player spins in place (rotY +0.93 every 4 VIs),
picks the P.F.M. layer and never takes damage. The recorded input is read or applied wrongly
(the Demo_* bit streams, `gControllers_buttons`' 0x224 `Slot` view, `fastForward`). This is
x4's determinism subject, reported to the coordinator. Neither host matches the N64.

## 3. Per-scene table (Linux port at 5437cfc0 + 2.1, vs Rice)

| scene | emulator / port frame | geometry | actors | lighting / colour | HUD / text | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| legal screen | 300 / 601 | n/a | n/a | n/a | same layout, **text ~2x dimmer, more orange** | differs (2.3) |
| expansion pak | 500 / 1201 | same | same (the pak model) | same | same | match |
| Acclaim logo | 700 / 1701 | same | logo animation same | same | n/a | match (phase only) |
| Iguana cinema | 850-1350 / 2043-4143 | same jungle, fog, sky | **iguanas missing** -> present after 2.1 | same actor lights (22230f/e6ef6a) | logo letters same | fixed |
| title | 1500 / 4500 | n/a | n/a | same | same | match |
| demo 1 | 2000-3150 / 5467-8900 | level 81 same | enemies drawn | volumes and ComputeLights identical (2.2) | HUD same place | **path differs** (2.4) |
| level 52 combat (w2 script) | (no N64 run) | n/a | dark enemies | lights computed from the same data | n/a | consistent with 2.2 |

## 4. Next

1. Demo 1's input (2.4): with the demo following the N64 path, the emulator frames 2000-3150 can
   be compared shot by shot (enemies, amber lighting, damage).
2. The legal text's colour (2.3); then the HUD and menu text, which may share the cause.
3. A new-game route on the N64 with `--input` (keyboard presses through `M64CMD_SEND_SDL_KEYDOWN`
   are wired but not yet checked in a menu) so levels 51/52 can be compared by position.
